= Hazelcast Secure WAN Replication through Contour ingress (Enterprise Only)

This is a complete example presenting how to set a secure WAN Replication through Contour ingress between two Hazelcast clusters deployed in two different Kubernetes environments.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide you will create two Hazelcast clusters and will set up secure WAN Replication between them. The clusters will be deployed in two different Kubernetes environments and the receiver cluster's Kubernetes will have Contour configured as ingress controller.

== Introduction

This example focuses on the WAN Replication feature and assumes that you have some general knowledge about Hazelcast on Kubernetes. Here are some resources:

* https://hazelcast.com/product-features/wan-replication/[Hazelcast WAN Replication]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes README]
* xref:kubernetes-wan:ROOT:index.adoc[Hazelcast WAN Replication on Kubernetes Guide]
* xref:kubernetes:ROOT:index.adoc[Hazelcast on Kubernetes Guide]
* xref:kubernetes-embedded:ROOT:index.adoc[Embedded Hazelcast on Kubernetes Guide]

The example also assumes you have the following:

- Two running Kubernetes clusters: The `Publisher` and the `Receiver` clusters.
- The `Receiver` cluster has Contour ingress controller installed. Please see https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/[the Contour getting started guide] for more information. This guide is tested with Contour v1.15.1.
- The `kubectl` tool installed on your local. For all the commands the indication (`Receiver`) means that `kubectl` uses the context of the receiver cluster, and the indication (`Publisher`) means that `kubectl` uses the context of the publisher cluster.

[NOTE]
====
This Code Sample presents WAN Replication via LoadBalancer, which may result in the communication over only one of the target members.

== WAN Replication via TLS Session Proxying or Passthrough

Contour's `HTTPProxy` supports https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.13.1/config/tls-termination/#tls-session-proxying[proxying of TLS encapsulated TCP sessions]. This means the TLS will be terminated on Contour ingress and the `HTTPProxy` will forward the de-encrypted TCP traffic to the Hazelcast WAN endpoint.

If you wish to handle the TLS handshake at the Hazelcast cluster, you need to set `spec.virtualhost.tls.passthrough: true` when configuring `HTTPProxy`. This indicates that the encrypted connection will be forwarded to the backend service without any TLS termination.

This guide covers both scenarios, just pick one of the configurations when available for both TLS Session Proxying or Passthrough.

== 1. Create Receiver Cluster

Hazelcast uses Kubernetes API for the member discovery and it therefore requires granting view permission to certain resources.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml
----

Firstly, create a secret with the Hazelcast Enterprise license key.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key --from-literal license=<hz-license-key>
----

To secure the connection between Hazelcast clusters, we need to make keys available as secrets.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create secret generic keystore --from-file=keystore --from-file=truststore
----

Then, create the Hazelcast member configuration.

[tabs]
====

TLS Session Proxying::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=hazelcast.yaml=receiver/session-proxying-hazelcast.yaml
----
--

TLS Session Passthrough::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=hazelcast.yaml=receiver/session-passthrough-hazelcast.yaml
----
--

====

[NOTE]
====
If you check the `receiver/session-proxying-hazelcast.yaml` configuration, you'll see that *SSL is not enabled* for `wan-server-socket-endpoint-config`. This is required for TLS session proxying, because the secure connection from publisher cluster will be de-encrypted on Contour ingress controller and Hazelcast receiver cluster will accept these non-TLS TCP connections from Contour for WAN replication.

However, `receiver/session-passthrough-hazelcast.yaml` has the `wan-server-socket-endpoint-config` configuration with *SSL enabled* since the Hazelcast cluster is expected to be capable of completing the TLS handshake when Contour is configured with session passthrough.
====

Also, create a Hazelcast client configuration to access the cluster for verification.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create configmap hazelcast-client-configuration --from-file=hazelcast-client.yaml
----

Now, you can create the cluster with the following command.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl apply -f receiver/statefulset.yaml
----

Check that the cluster works correctly. Please note that `service/hazelcast` is a `ClusterIP` service and not directly accessible from outside of the k8s cluster. To access the Hazelcast cluster, we will setup Contour's `HTTPProxy` custom resource.

[source, shell]

== 2. Configure Contour's `HTTPProxy`

Please apply either one of the sections below to configure Contour's `HTTPProxy` accordingly:

=== Configuring with TLS Session Proxying

First, you need to configure the TLS secrets for secure connection. Run the following command with Base64 encoded certificate and key files:

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create secret tls hz-secret --cert=client.pem --key=client.key
----

Then, update the `HTTPProxy` configuration in receiver/contour-proxying.yaml with the FQDN of your receiver cluster:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1
kind: HTTPProxy
metadata:
  name: hz-proxy
  namespace: default
spec:
  virtualhost:
    fqdn: your-cluster-domain-name
    tls:
      secretName: hz-secret
  tcpproxy:
    services:
      - name: hazelcast
        port: 11010
----

Now, you can run command below to setup `HTTPProxy`:

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl apply -f receiver/contour-proxying.yaml
----

Check that `HTTPProxy` is valid and setup correctly:

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl get httpproxies
NAME       FQDN                       TLS SECRET    STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
hz-proxy   your-cluster-domain-name   hz-secret     valid    Valid HTTPProxy
----

=== Configuring with TLS Session Passthrough

When configuring with TLS Session Passthrough, you don't need to configure a TLS secret for Contour since the TLS handshake is completed at Hazelcast cluster.

Firstly, update the `HTTPProxy` configuration in receiver/contour-passthrough.yaml with the FQDN of your receiver cluster:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1
kind: HTTPProxy
metadata:
  name: hz-proxy-pass
  namespace: default
spec:
  virtualhost:
    fqdn: your-cluster-domain-name
    tls:
      passthrough: true
  tcpproxy:
    services:
      - name: hazelcast
        port: 11010
----

Then, run the following command to setup `HTTPProxy`:

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl apply -f receiver/contour-passthrough.yaml
----

Check that `HTTPProxy` is valid and setup correctly:

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl get httpproxies
NAME            FQDN                           TLS SECRET   STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
hz-proxy-pass   your-cluster-domain-name                    valid    Valid HTTPProxy
----

== 3. Create Publisher Cluster

Again, we need to grant Kubernetes API resource permissions.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml
----

Then, update the WAN Replication configuration in publisher/hazelcast.yaml with the FQDN of your receiver cluster. Please keep `443` in the end as port.

[source, yaml]
----
...
  wan-replication:
    my-wan-replication:
      batch-publisher:
        my-publisher:
          cluster-name: dev
          target-endpoints: your-cluster-domain-name:443
          endpoint: receiver-endpoint
...
----

[NOTE]
====
If you check the `publisher/hazelcast.yaml` configuration, you'll see that SSL is *enabled* for `wan-endpoint-config`. This is required for both TLS session proxying or passthrough.
====

Create ConfigMap with the Hazelcast configuration.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=publisher/hazelcast.yaml
----

Also, create a Hazelcast client configuration to access the cluster for verification.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl create configmap hazelcast-client-configuration --from-file=hazelcast-client.yaml
----

Again, we need to create a secret with the Hazelcast Enterprise license key.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key --from-literal license=<hz-license-key>
----

Also, we again need to make keys available as secrets.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl create secret generic keystore --from-file=keystore --from-file=truststore
----

Finally, we can start the publisher Hazelcast cluster.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl apply -f publisher/statefulset.yaml
----

Your two Hazelcast clusters are set up with the WAN Replication. Now, we can check if everything works correctly.

== 3. Verify WAN Replication

Insert data into the publisher Hazelcast cluster

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl exec -it hazelcast-0 -- /bin/bash
# java -cp lib/hazelcast-enterprise-all*.jar -Dhazelcast.client.config=/data/hazelcast/client/hazelcast-client.yaml com.hazelcast.client.console.ClientConsoleApp
hazelcast[default] > ns rep
namespace: rep
hazelcast[rep] > m.put key value
null
----

Check that the data was replicated to the receiver Hazelcast cluster.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl exec -it hazelcast-0 -- /bin/bash
# java -cp lib/hazelcast-enterprise-all*.jar -Dhazelcast.client.config=/data/hazelcast/client/hazelcast-client.yaml com.hazelcast.client.console.ClientConsoleApp
hazelcast[default] > ns rep
hazelcast[rep] > m.get key
value
----

== Summary

In this example we have seen how to use Hazelcast WAN replication features through Contour ingress controller to keep multiple Hazelcast clusters in sync. WAN replication can be very useful for https://hazelcast.com/resources/multi-cloud-deployments-run-hazelcast-anywhere-and-everywhere/[Multi-Cloud Deployments].
